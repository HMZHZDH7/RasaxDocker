responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! I've started out by showing you your door to needle time since it has been increasing over the past few quarters."

  utter_new_selected_value:
    - text: "I can also show you the median value for your country. I can also use some statistical tests to validate if the difference between quarters is real. How should I help?"

  utter_ask_statistical_test:
    - text: "Shall I use some statistical tests to validate if the difference between quarters is real"

  utter_cause_or_effect:
    - text: "You can choose to either analyse the cause of this increase or I we can explore how this effects your patients. What shall I do for you?"

  utter_ask_plot_type:
    - text: "What type of plot do you want to create?"

  utter_ask_selected_value:
    - text: "What value you want to see?"

  utter_submit_create_plot_form:
    - text: "Great! I will create the plot with the specified details. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

  utter_ask_build_model:
    - text: "Shall I use my A.I. abilities to find some possible causes for this difference? Or would you rather analyse the impact of this change on patient outcomes?"

  utter_ask_local_predictors:
    - text: "These are based on data from multiple hospitals in your country. Should I perform this analysis only for your hospital? Otherwise, tell me which indicator you want to explore."

  utter_ask_causes_or_guidelines:
    - text: "If you like, I can use my A.I. to propose ways to improve patient outcomes. Otherwise, we can look if your hospital meets WSO guidelines."

  #utter_explore_effects:
  #  - text: "Would you rather look at: mRS at discharge or NIHSS?"
